# Lab 3 - Grove Light Sensor Experiment 
## Introduction
The Light sensor module uses the GL5528 photoresistor to detect the light intensity of the environment. This example for the Grove shield uses Grove Light Sensor. This program displays the analog in values.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).

## Dependencies
- NXP FRDM K64F development board
- Grove Shield
- Grove Light Sensor
